Green Youth Thailand, 
founded in early 2022 by Benyapa Achariyakarun or Opall, is a youth-led environmental organization addressing the lack of awareness among Thai youths on environmental issues. Our mission is to empower youth through creative media and initiatives.

With 25 active members, we've co-organized 30+ events promoting environmental awareness. In 2024, we aim to expand climate education throughout Thailand, emphasizing grassroots action and community projects. Join us in cultivating a sustainable future. 🌱 #GreenYouth #ClimateAction

Successful First Exhibition: Connecting Minds for Climate Action! ✨1️⃣🏆

Green Youth Thailand is incredibly honored to be selected to exhibit our work at the Asia Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, held from February 20 to 23, 2024. We are one of the youth groups who advocate for climate action and the need for youth inclusion in all discussions and decisions. 🙋🏻‍♀️

It was a privilege to connect with passionate individuals who share our goals. We were thrilled to represent both our organization and the voices of youth across Asia-Pacific. We were particularly inspired by the discussions on:

🗣Public Awareness: Knowledge is power!
⭐️Youth Opportunities: Get involved!
🦸🏻‍♀️Your Role in Climate Action: Use your voice!
💡Generating New Ideas: Brainstorm with us!
☕️Our Youth Climate Circle: Join the movement!

## Exited News From Green Youth Thailand ##

We learned the power of collaboration and are committed to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by joining forces with other changemakers. 🤝🏻

The goal of keeping the limit of global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, requires everyone's involvement in climate action. Youth will play a crucial role in driving change, and our organization, powered by the people, aims to spearhead that movement. 🌎

Taking the stage at a regional forum is a significant step for our youth-led organization. We are determined to continue our work because it's about the Earth we all share and the urgent need to take action. Keep going, Green Youth! 💚
